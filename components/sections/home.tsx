          I'm a 2nd-year Computer Science undergraduate at Jain University, passionate about building AI/ML systems that are not only intelligentâ€”but interpretable, ethical, and human-aligned.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          As an AI Researcher and Software Developer, I explore Generative AI, Diffusion Models, Large Language Models (LLMs), and systems that blend scientific depth with real-world impact. As a member of my university's R&D Club, I engage in experimental projectsâ€”from automating image pipelines to reconstructing environments in 3D using LIDAR data.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Currently, I'm contributing to India's first Telugu LLM initiative, helping design culturally grounded datasets and exploring efficient training techniques with distributed compute. This work showcases my expertise in AI development and machine learning.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Outside of code, I dive deep into philosophy, systems theory, and emerging tech like blockchain and neuro-AIâ€”seeking to connect the abstract with the practical. My approach combines technical expertise with ethical considerations in artificial intelligence.
