          I&apos;m Bharath, a Computer Science undergraduate at Jain University, Bangalore, with a deep passion for Artificial Intelligence, 
          Large Language Models (LLMs), and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). My academic journey is focused on understanding and 
          developing cutting-edge AI technologies while maintaining a strong emphasis on ethical AI implementation.

        <p className="mb-4">
          As an active member of the R&D Club at Jain University, I collaborate with peers on innovative projects that push the boundaries
          of what&apos;s possible with today&apos;s technology. My work spans across machine learning, natural language processing, and 
          generative AI, with a particular interest in developing solutions that are both technically advanced and ethically sound.

        <p>
          Beyond my technical pursuits, I&apos;m deeply interested in the philosophical implications of AI development, cryptocurrency 
          technologies, and emerging innovations that will shape our future. This interdisciplinary approach helps me bring unique 
          perspectives to my work in AI and technology development.
